## Inspiration
The text comes from the homework in the critical studies class
imagine a new space station, one where diffference is not erased but embraced. 

I wrote a dialogue to introduce the setting of the space station through the dialogue between visitors and hosts. By exchanging identities, we can experience the energy and feelings of different people, so as to eliminate the prejudice and difference of age, skin and gender

## Introduction
The circle in the centre with words that from a new space.txt 
I load the text and choose font , and make the circle to rotate, 
* load words from a file into a vector 
* create custom soring functions
* sort the vector using the funtion
* view text in 3D with easyCam
* load  text from using fileDialog 
* load text from a remote URL 
* control music speed with mouse
* loading a txt file from the web

* ```ofLoadURLAsync```request to load an image and passes the url
* ```void ofApp::urlRespone```handle the response from the request 
* ```ofSoundPlayer```


## Action 
* 5-8 to switch soring algorithms
* l open file dialog to lad text file from disk
* w to load a txt file from the web at a remote url
* b to autorotate the circle in 3d
* f to toggle fullscreen display
